# TO-DO list web app
This project has two versions:
1. Plain HTML CSS JS version

This verion of the project was specifically made for my DEV blog [LINK](https://dev.to/miljkovicjovan/making-a-to-do-list-web-app-using-simple-javascript-2a0c)
With this web app you can add new list items,
highlight them and delete them when done.
